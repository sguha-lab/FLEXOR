# FLEXOR
This R package implements integrative weighting approaches for multiple observational studies and causal inferences about various groups of subjects, such as disease subtypes, introduced in “Causal Meta-Analysis by Integrating Multiple Observational Studies with Multivariate Outcomes” (Guha and Li, 2004; Biometrics).

The FLEXOR package contains a script replication file named demoAnalyze.R to demonstrate the package installation, compute balancing weights for a pseudo-population (Stage 1 analysis), and implement effectuate causal inferences (Stage 2 analysis). Please refer to Guha and Li (2004) for the theoretical details.
